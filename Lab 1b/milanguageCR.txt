58 - A string is a sequence of letters, digits, underscores, and spaces enclosed in double quotation marks ("").
59 - string = ""{letter|digit|"_"| " "}""
Question: The double quotes are not exactly clear to me, should strings be formatted like ""string"" ? The examples in Lab 1a use single quotes.

// Syntax.in

6 - arr_statement = types identifier"[" positive_number "]" clean_identifier_list
Nit: add a space between "types identifier" and the square bracket

11 - string_expression = string | identifier | string_expression + string_expression
Shouldn't the last option be string_expression "+" string_expression?

19 - function_call_statement = function_name "(" expression_list? ")"
Nit: remove the "?" in "expression_list?"

20 - function_name = "milafisezi" | "milcitesti" | "milreturnezi"
Question: in the examples, you use milafisezi with "pe" and milcitesti with "in". Is that still the case here, are they now going to be simple function calls?

// Overall

Really fun stuff, everything is cleanly written, simple but to the point, good repo organisation as well, looking forward to see how this project evolves.
